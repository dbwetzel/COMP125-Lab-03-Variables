# Lab 3 - Declare Your Own Variables

In this sketch, we start with a blank gray canvas. Your job is to create a new variable, using the "var" keyword and assign it an initial value. You can name your variable anything you like as long as it does not begin with a number (var 1potato is NOT allowed, but var potato1 is OK).

### What to do:

1. **declare** a variable in line 7 of script.js and assign it a value

for example:

```javascript
var x = 320; 
```

2. **Apply** that variable in a P5 function call inside the draw() function (line 18)

for example:

```javascript
ellipse(x, 240, 50, 50);
```

... draws a 50 pixel diameter circle x pixels from the left and 240 pixels from the top 

3. **Download** your lab project as a Zip archive and submit it under "Lab 3b" (with a link also) in Sakai
